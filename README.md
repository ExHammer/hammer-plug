# Hammer.Plug

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ExHammer/hammer-plug.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ExHammer/hammer-plug)

[Hammer](https://github.com/ExHammer/hammer) is a rate-limiter for Elixir, with pluggable storage backends.

This library is a [plug](https://hexdocs.pm/plug/readme.html) helper, to easily add rate-limiting to Phoenix applications,
or any Elixir system that uses plug.

Example:

```elixir
# Allow ten uploads per 60 seconds
plug Hammer.Plug, [
  rate_limit: {"video:upload", 60_000, 10},
  by: {:session, :user_id}
] when action == :upload_video_file

def upload_video_file(conn, _opts) do
  # ...
end
```
